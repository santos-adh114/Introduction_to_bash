#!/bin/bash         # This line basically asks to run the script with bash  
echo Hello World!!  # This will print the string "Hellow World!!"
echo                # This will print empty line.
a="First go"        # We are assigning string "First go" to a variable a
b=10                # We are assigning integer 10 to a variable b
c=15.4              # We are assigning floating number to a variable c
echo a,$a,$b,$c,$d  # Remember echo a simply prints a, while echo $a prints "First go". Always use a dollar sign $ before a variable.
